# XRSF: eXtended Robotics Security Framework

The **eXtended Robot Security Framework (XRSF)** is a fork of [aliasrobotics/RSF](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RSF), adapted to incorporate a structured methodology for analyzing the **cognitive knowledge state** of autonomous robots. This extension bridges the gap between **robotic decision-making**, **explainability**, and **cybersecurity risks**.


## 游빐 Project Goal

XRSF explores and systematizes how autonomous decisions, their traceability, and their impact on the environment can be assessed from a cybersecurity and explainability perspective. It offers a conceptual and practical framework to evaluate decision-making risks in robots through empirical evidence.

## 游댌 Key Contributions

- An explicit connection between these metrics and the concepts of **risk**, **explainability**, and **security**.
- An extended version of RSF, including tools, examples, and data to apply this analysis in simulated or real-world scenarios.

##  Application

In this case we are going to have in mind Cognive architecture and cloud infraestrucure for those cases which are not local.

## 游닄 Research Context

This work is part of the ongoing project [EDMAR](https://dmarce-project.github.io/):

> **Cybersecurity Challenges in Autonomous Robots: The Link Between Explainability and Decision-Making Risks**

It investigates the connection between observable robot behavior and the security risks that emerge from decisions that are non-transparent, unjustified, or poorly grounded.
