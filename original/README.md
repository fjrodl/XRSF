unsecured robots. Monitoring and control capabilities should be implemented on the
internal network of the robot either through the manufacturer or through additional

alerting should be determined by the impact of possible false positives on the operative

## Glossary
- **component**: a part of something that is discrete and identifiable with respect to combining with other parts to produce something larger (*source: ISO/IEC 24765*).
  - *Note 1 to entry*: Component can be either software or hardware. Even a component that is mainly software or hardware can be referred to as a software or hardware component respectively.
- **module**: component with special characteristics to facilitate system design, integration, interoperability, re-use.
- **interoperability**: the capability to communicate and transfer data among modules and combine modules physically in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those modules.
- **firmware**: (in the context of robotics) software that is embedded in robots.
